## Introduction
This project aims to provide a functional Express.js API for an e-commerce website backend. It utilizes Sequelize, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js, to interact with a MySQL database. With this backend setup, you can manage categories, products, and tags efficiently.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
'git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-backend.git'

Navigate to the project directory:
'cd e-commerce-backend''

Install the required dependencies using:
'npm install'

## Usage
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your MySQL database configuration:
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password


Run the following commands to set up the database schema and seed initial data:
npm start

Once the server is running, you can use a tool like Insomnia Core to test the API routes.
